# Publishing

```powershell
dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release
```

will produce a `.dll` containing CIL and pre-compiled native code in the Ready To Run format alongside a binary that bootstraps the runtime.

## Viewing CIL

You can peek at the CIL using a tool called `ildasm` from a local Checked build of [CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr):

```powershell
cd bin/Release/netcoreapp3.0/win-x64/publish

path/to/coreclr/bin/Product/Windows_NT.x64.Checked/ildasm CoreCLR.ReadyToRun.dll
```

## Viewing Pre-JIT'ed code

You can use the `R2RDump.dll` tool (which requires a local build of [CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr)) to inspect the native code bundled into the `.dll`:

```powershell
cd bin/Release/netcoreapp3.0/win-x64/publish

dotnet path/to/coreclr/bin/Product/Windows_NT.x64.Checked/R2RDump.dll --in CoreCLR.ReadyToRun.dll
```

To get actual disassembly, you need a library called `coredistools`. It's part of the [LLILC project](https://github.com/dotnet/llilc) and can be built from there and copied into the publish directory:

```powershell
cp path/to/llilc-llvm-clone/build/lib/coredistools.dll . 
```

(it'll be called `libcoredistools.dylib` on OSX or `libcoredistools.so` on Linux).

Then you can add a `-d` flag to `R2RDump.dll`:

```powershell
dotnet path/to/coreclr/bin/Product/Windows_NT.x64.Checked/R2RDump.dll --in CoreCLR.ReadyToRun.dll -d
```

## Viewing JIT'ed code

With a local Checked build of [CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), you can see any JIT'ed code:

```powershell
$env:COMPlus_JitDisasm="CoreCLR.ReadyToRun.Program:Main(ref)"
```

```powershell
cd bin/Release/netcoreapp3.0/win-x64/publish
cp path/to/coreclr/bin/Product/Windows_NT.x64.Checked/* .

./corerun CoreCLR.ReadyToRun.dll
```

If you run the above you should see no extra output, because we did the JIT'ing at compile time!

## Debugging

You can debug a managed .NET app running in CoreCLR using LLDB:

```powershell
cd bin/Release/netcoreapp3.0/win-x64/publish

lldb ./corerun CoreCLR.ReadyToRun.dll
```

LLDB can't interpret what's going on in the .NET runtime on its own. It needs a plugin to do that. It's called `sos` and is shipped as part of the [Diagnostics repository](https://github.com/dotnet/diagnostics):

```
plugin load path/to/diagnostics/artifacts/bin/dotnet-sos/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/publish/win-x64/libsosplugin.dylib
run
```

```
setsymbolserver -ms
loadsymbols
```

We can view the native stack:

```
bt
```

it includes some `corerun` frames at the bottom and some funny looking ones at the top. The frames at the top are the ones generated by the JIT from our CIL. Using a command like `gui` can let us explore these native frames more easily.

We can view the .NET runtime's view of our managed stack:

```
clrstack
```

it omits the `corerun` frames, and gives us something closer to what we'd expect to see when using the CLR debugger.

We can look at some annotated assembly for our C# code:

```
clru 0000000108702CAE
```

where `0000000108702CAE` is the code address for our `Main` method.
