# Publishing

```powershell
dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release
```

will produce a `.dll` containing CIL alongside a binary that bootstraps the runtime. The CIL will be compiled into native code on the end-user's machine by the [CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr) JIT.

## Viewing CIL

You can peek at the CIL using a tool called `ildasm` from a local Checked build of [CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr):

```powershell
path/to/coreclr/bin/Product/Windows_NT.x64.Checked/ildasm CoreCLR.JIT.dll
```

## Viewing JIT'ed code

Your local Checked build of [CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr) can also dump the JIT'ed code at runtime:

```powershell
$env:COMPlus_JitDisasm="CoreCLR.JIT.Program:Main(ref)"
```

```powershell
cd bin/Release/netcoreapp3.0/win-x64/publish
cp path/to/coreclr/bin/Product/Windows_NT.x64.Checked/* .

./corerun CoreCLR.JIT.dll
```

## Debugging

You can debug a managed .NET app running in CoreCLR using LLDB:

```powershell
cd bin/Release/netcoreapp3.0/win-x64/publish

lldb ./corerun CoreCLR.JIT.dll
```

LLDB can't interpret what's going on in the .NET runtime on its own. It needs a plugin to do that. It's called `sos` and is shipped as part of the [Diagnostics repository](https://github.com/dotnet/diagnostics):

```
plugin load path/to/diagnostics/artifacts/bin/dotnet-sos/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/publish/win-x64/libsosplugin.dylib
run
```

```
setsymbolserver -ms
loadsymbols
```

We can view the native stack:

```
bt
```

it includes some `corerun` frames at the bottom and some funny looking ones at the top. The frames at the top are the ones generated by the JIT from our CIL. Using a command like `gui` can let us explore these native frames more easily.

We can view the .NET runtime's view of our managed stack:

```
clrstack
```

it omits the `corerun` frames, and gives us something closer to what we'd expect to see when using the CLR debugger.

We can look at some annotated assembly for our C# code:

```
clru 0000000108702CAE
```

where `0000000108702CAE` is the code address for our `Main` method.
